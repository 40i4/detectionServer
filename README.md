# Fuel App: receipt detection server
A server written with Flask framework (http://flask.pocoo.org/) as a part of my B.Sc. project.
It receives a photo from the client, performs detection and sends detected object to the client. 

The script used to detect the object is decribed here: https://github.com/40i4/receiptDetection
